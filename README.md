# gus

gus should be a generic solution for setting up a REST-ful webserver with a database backend.

The idea is that the defined models (json) will be parsed and used by the model-layer (model controller view). The controller, the actual webserver, will implement the REST-API for the them (I hope).

In the end it would be a nice and simple binary tool for private use.
