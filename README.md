# gus

gus will be a general solution for setting up a REST-ful webserver with a database backend.

The idea is that the defined models (json) will be parsed and used by the model-layer (model controller view). The controller, the actual webserver, will serve the REST-API for them.<br>
There will be a fully functional view layer as well, but first I need to enhance my frontend skills.

In the end, gus would be a nice and simple binary tool for private or whatever use. Of course I will try to make it as customizable and convenient as possible.
